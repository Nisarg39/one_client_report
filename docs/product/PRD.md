Requirements Document (PRD)
OneReport - Simplified Marketing Reports for Small Agencies
Domain: www.onereport.in
Version: 1.0
Date: October 30, 2025
Status: Draft

1. Executive Summary
Product Vision
Create a simple, affordable client reporting tool that helps freelance marketers and small agencies generate professional marketing reports in 5 minutes instead of spending hours manually compiling data.
The Opportunity
The marketing reporting space is dominated by expensive, feature-bloated enterprise tools (AgencyAnalytics, DashThis) charging $100-500/month, and free but complex solutions (Google Looker Studio) requiring technical expertise. Small agencies and freelancers are underserved - they need something simple, affordable, and fast.
Success Definition

Launch with 50 paying customers in first 3 months
Average setup time under 10 minutes
Customer acquisition cost under $100
Monthly churn rate below 5%


2. Market Analysis
2.1 Target Market Size
Primary Target Audience:

Freelance Digital Marketers - 200,000+ globally

Managing 3-10 clients simultaneously
Annual spending potential: $200-600 on reporting tools


Small Marketing Agencies (2-10 employees) - 100,000+ globally

Managing 10-30 clients
Annual spending potential: $600-1,200 on reporting tools


In-House Marketing Managers - 150,000+ at small-medium businesses

Reporting to executives monthly
Annual spending potential: $300-700 on reporting tools



Total Addressable Market (TAM): 450,000+ potential users
Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): 5,000 customers by Year 3 (1.1% penetration)
2.2 Market Trends
Growing Demand Drivers:

Remote work explosion - More freelancers and micro-agencies than ever
Multi-platform marketing - Clients demand unified reporting across Google, Meta, etc.
AI adoption - Businesses expect insights, not just data dumps
Budget consciousness - Economic uncertainty driving demand for affordable tools
Time scarcity - Agencies want to spend time on strategy, not manual reporting

Market Shifts:

Away from complex enterprise tools toward "good enough" simple solutions
From generic dashboards to AI-powered insights
Per-client pricing models → Flat-rate pricing gaining popularity
Desktop-only → Mobile-first expectations

Key Competitive Insights
What competitors do well:

Comprehensive integrations (50-80+ platforms)
White-label capabilities
Automated data collection
Historical data storage

Where competitors fail:

Complex onboarding - Takes 1-2 hours to create first report
Expensive pricing - $100-500/month for 10-20 clients
Feature overload - 80+ integrations when users need 5
Generic outputs - Templates require hours of customization
No intelligence - Show data but don't explain it
Poor mobile experience - Desktop-focused tools

2.4 Market Gap Analysis
The Underserved Segment:
Freelancers and small agencies (1-5 person teams) managing 5-25 clients who:

Can't afford $200-500/month tools
Don't need 80+ integrations
Don't have time to learn complex platforms
Want beautiful reports without customization work
Need to explain data to non-technical clients

Market Gap Opportunity:
A "Canva for marketing reports" - beautiful by default, simple to use, AI-powered insights, affordable pricing.

3. Customer Pain Points
3.1 Pain Point Discovery (User Research Summary)
Research Methods:

Interviewed 25 freelance marketers and small agency owners
Analyzed 500+ reviews of AgencyAnalytics, DashThis, Looker Studio
Surveyed 100 freelancers in marketing communities
Shadowed 5 agencies during their reporting process

3.2 Primary Pain Points
Pain Point #1: Time-Consuming Manual Work
The Problem:

Freelancers spend 6-10 hours/month creating client reports manually
Small agencies waste 20-40 hours/month across team
Process: Log into 3-4 platforms → Export data → Copy to Slides → Create charts → Write explanations → Send to client

Customer Quote:

"I charge $1,500/month per client but spend 8 hours monthly just on reporting. That's $240 of my time gone just to show what I already did." - Sarah, Freelance Social Media Manager

Impact:

Lost billable hours (8hrs/mo × $50/hr = $400 opportunity cost)
Reduced time for actual client work
Burnout and resentment toward "administrative" tasks

Current Workarounds:

Manual Google Slides/PowerPoint creation
Spreadsheet exports with minimal context
Screenshots pasted into documents
Skipping reports entirely (risky for renewals)


Pain Point #2: Expensive Tools for Small Operations
The Problem:

AgencyAnalytics costs $12-179/client/month ($120-500/mo for 10 clients)
DashThis costs $33-289/month
Small agencies pay $2,000-6,000/year for reporting tools
Per-client pricing doesn't make sense for small retainers

Customer Quote:

"I only charge $800/month per client. Paying $12/month per client for reporting alone eats into my already thin margins. I need the whole service under $50." - Mike, 3-Person Agency

Impact:

Forces choice between profit margins and professional tools
Many stick with manual reporting despite time cost
Can't compete with larger agencies who afford better tools

Current Workarounds:

Free Google Looker Studio (requires technical skills)
Manual reporting in Slides/Docs
Sharing raw platform dashboards (unprofessional)


Pain Point #3: Complex Setup & Learning Curve
The Problem:

Current tools take 1-2 hours to configure first report
Requires understanding of data connections, template customization, metric selection
Steep learning curve discourages adoption
Team members need training to use consistently

Customer Quote:

"I tried AgencyAnalytics for a week during trial. Spent 3 hours watching tutorials and still couldn't make a report that looked good. Gave up and went back to PowerPoint." - Jennifer, Marketing Manager

Impact:

Tool abandonment during trial period
Inconsistent report quality across team
Resistance from team members to adopt new tools
Wasted money on subscriptions that don't get used

Current Workarounds:

One person becomes "report expert" (bottleneck)
Stick with known manual processes
Use only basic features of advanced tools


Pain Point #4: Generic Templates Look Unprofessional
The Problem:

Default templates look dated, generic, or "obviously automated"
Require 2-3 hours of customization per client to look professional
Charts and visualizations look amateurish without design skills
Reports don't reflect agency brand

Customer Quote:

"The reports from DashThis look like every other agency's reports. My clients pay premium for personalized service, and the reports should reflect that." - Alex, Boutique Agency Owner

Impact:

Perceived lower value by clients
Time spent customizing undermines automation benefit
Harder to justify premium pricing
Risk of looking like "just another agency"

Current Workarounds:

Hire designers to create custom templates (expensive)
Manually recreate charts in design tools
Accept mediocre-looking reports
Over-customize, spending hours per report


Pain Point #5: Data Without Insights
The Problem:

Existing tools show metrics but don't explain what they mean
Clients ask "What does this mean?" after receiving reports
Requires additional meetings to walk through reports
Non-technical clients don't understand marketing metrics

Customer Quote:

"My clients see '25% increase in CTR' and ask 'Is that good? Why did it happen? What should we do next?' The report creates more questions than it answers." - Rachel, PPC Specialist

Impact:

Additional unpaid time explaining reports
Clients don't perceive value of work
Harder to justify rate increases
Risk of client churn due to lack of understanding

Current Workarounds:

Manually write executive summaries (time-consuming)
Schedule extra calls to explain data (unpaid time)
Provide raw data with minimal context
Hope clients understand metrics (they often don't)


Pain Point #6: No Mobile Access
The Problem:

Most reporting tools are desktop-only or have poor mobile experiences
Can't review or share reports on-the-go
Clients expect mobile-friendly deliverables
Can't quickly check report before client meeting

Customer Quote:

"I'm often traveling between client meetings. I need to pull up reports on my phone, but the PDFs are unreadable and the dashboards don't work on mobile." - Carlos, Agency Account Manager

Impact:

Missed opportunities to review before meetings
Poor client experience with mobile PDFs
Inability to make last-minute updates
Appearing unprepared in meetings

Current Workarounds:

Carry laptop everywhere
Screenshot key metrics for mobile viewing
Email simplified versions to self
Avoid opening reports on mobile entirely

**ENTERPRISE CUSTOM PRICING STRATEGY:**

Our Enterprise tier uses personalized negotiation for several strategic reasons:

**1. High-Value Customer Customization:**
- Each large agency has unique needs (report volume, integrations, SLAs)
- Custom pricing allows us to optimize for their specific use case
- Prevents leaving money on the table or overpricing

**2. Competitive Intelligence:**
- Negotiation process reveals what competitors are charging
- Allows us to undercut by exactly the right margin
- Helps us understand enterprise pain points for product development

**3. Relationship Building:**
- Personal sales process builds stronger customer relationships
- Dedicated account manager assigned during sales process
- Higher retention rates for high-touch customers

**4. Margin Optimization:**
- For 500+ reports/month, AI costs are significant ($75-100/month)
- Custom pricing ensures we maintain 60-70% margins at scale
- Annual contracts provide predictable revenue and cash flow

**5. Market Positioning:**
- "Contact us for Enterprise" signals we can handle large scale
- Creates perception of exclusivity and premium service
- Filters out tire-kickers, focuses sales team on qualified leads

**Typical Enterprise Pricing Range:**
- 100-200 clients: ~₹25,000-30,000/month
- 200-500 clients: ~₹40,000-50,000/month
- 500+ clients: ~₹60,000-100,000/month
- Target margins: 60-70% gross margin (vs 75-90% on lower tiers)
- Still 50-70% cheaper than AgencyAnalytics at enterprise scale

**Why This Pricing Works:**

**Market Research Insights:**
- Student segment needs free tier for learning (5 workspaces, 50 messages/day forever)
- Freelancers manage 10-20 clients, need unlimited AI insights after trial
- Small agencies manage 25-50 clients, need unlimited AI insights for client work
- Enterprise agencies manage 100+ clients, need unlimited access
- Industry pricing: ₹3,250-33,000/month for entry/mid-tier plans, ₹83,000-166,000/month for enterprise
- Our hybrid model (clients + unlimited messages) aligns with actual business needs
- 7-day trial with 50 msg/day limit lets users test before committing

**Cost Structure Analysis:**
- Infrastructure cost per user: ₹280-310/month (database, email, storage, hosting)
- AI cost per message: ₹12-17 (OpenAI GPT-4 API)
- AI cost per user/month: ₹600-850 (assuming 50 messages/day)
- Payment gateway fees: 2-3% + ₹3 per transaction (Razorpay/Stripe)
- Total variable costs: ₹900-1,200/month per paid user

**Profitability Metrics:**
- Student Plan: ₹0 revenue, -₹900-1,200 cost (loss leader for acquisition)
- Professional Plan: ~66% gross margin (₹100/month profit per user after costs)
- Agency Plan: ~86% gross margin (₹600/month profit per user after costs)
- Enterprise Plan: 95%+ gross margin (₹23,000+ profit per user at ₹25,000 pricing)

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Fixed costs (development, marketing, support): ~₹700,000-1,500,000/month
- Break-even with Professional tier focus: 7,000-15,000 customers (~₹21,00,000-45,00,000 MRR)
- Mixed tier strategy: 100 Student (free) + 2,000 Professional + 500 Agency = ₹9,47,500 MRR (approaching break-even)
- Profitable at: High volume model requiring 5,000-10,000 paid customers

Target Outcome:

98-99% cost savings vs competitors (extremely competitive for Indian market)
High volume, low margin strategy with sustainable gross margins (66-95%)
Hybrid model (clients + unlimited messages after trial) prevents abuse during trial while being generous for paying customers:
  - Student: 5 clients + 50 messages/day = sufficient for learning (FREE forever)
  - Professional: 20 clients + unlimited messages = daily insights for freelancers (₹299/mo)
  - Agency: 50 clients + unlimited messages = scalable for growing agencies (₹699/mo)
  - Enterprise: Unlimited = no restrictions for large operations (₹25,000+/mo)

5.4 What Success Looks Like (12-Month Vision)
Customer Success Story - Freelancer (Starter Plan):
"I used to spend 10 hours every month creating client reports manually. It was the worst part of my job. Now with OneReport, I connect my accounts once, click a button, and get a beautiful report in 3 minutes. My clients love the AI insights - they actually understand what's happening now. I've added 3 new clients because I have time back, which more than pays for the $49/month. This tool is a no-brainer."

Customer Success Story - Small Agency (Professional Plan):
"We're a 4-person agency managing 18 clients. Before OneReport, our team spent 25+ hours monthly on reports. At $99/month, we generate 50-60 reports and save thousands in labor costs. The white-label branding makes us look more professional, and the AI insights help us retain clients better. We upgraded from Starter within 2 weeks - the ROI is incredible."

Business Success:

250-300 paying customers generating $25,000-30,000 MRR
Strongly profitable with 25%+ net margin
Strong word-of-mouth growth (30%+ of signups from referrals)
Clear path to 1,000 customers and $100,000+ MRR in Year 2
Sustainable business with healthy unit economics (LTV:CAC 15:1+)

Product Success:

Used 3-5 times per month by average customer
<5% churn rate (high satisfaction)
Consistent 4.5+ star rating across review platforms
Featured in marketing/freelancer communities as "must-have tool"

Team Success:

Clear product roadmap driven by customer feedback
Sustainable business model requiring minimal ongoing development
Strong foundation to expand (more integrations, features, or niches)


6. Why We'll Win
6.1 Strategic Advantages
1. Underserved Market Focus

Competitors chase enterprise clients (higher complexity, slower decisions)
We focus on underserved freelancers and small agencies (faster decisions, lower CAC)
Market is large enough (100K+ potential customers) but focused enough to dominate

2. AI as a Moat

First-mover advantage in AI-powered marketing insights
AI quality improves with usage data (compound learning effect)
Difficult for competitors to retrofit AI into existing complex products
GPT-4 integration creates defensible differentiation

3. Simplicity as Strategy

Competitors can't simplify without abandoning enterprise customers
Our 5-platform focus allows exceptional quality vs their 80-platform breadth
Simpler product = faster iteration cycles
Better mobile experience due to less complexity

4. Pricing Power

Flat-rate pricing is sticky (customers resistant to per-client pricing)
Low price point reduces friction for trial-to-paid conversion
Room to add premium tiers without losing budget-conscious base
Can remain profitable at much lower ARPU than competitors

5. Product-Market Fit Velocity

Faster development cycles (less features to maintain)
Quicker customer feedback loops
Ability to pivot or adjust based on early signals
Lower burn rate = longer runway to find optimal strategy

8.3 Neumorphic Design Language
Visual Identity
Our product uses a **soft neumorphic design system** that creates depth and tactility while maintaining a professional, modern aesthetic, combined with a **mobile-first responsive approach** that ensures beautiful experiences across all devices. This design language differentiates us from flat, generic competitors and creates a premium feel at an affordable price point.

Key Design Characteristics:

**Soft 3D Elements**: UI components appear to gently float or sink into the background using dual shadow systems
**Smooth Surfaces**: Large border radius (16-24px) creates organic, approachable shapes
**Tactile Interactions**: Buttons and interactive elements have realistic press states
**Dark Theme Foundation**: Optimized for extended viewing sessions
**Premium Feel**: Enterprise-quality aesthetics without enterprise pricing


8.4 Color Palette

Background Colors

**Primary Background**: `#1a1a1a` - Medium-dark gray providing optimal contrast
**Inset Elements**: `#151515` - Slightly darker for pressed/sunken elements
**Raised Elements**: `#1a1a1a` - Same as background for floating effect


Brand Colors

**Primary (Orange)**: `#FF8C42` to `#E67A33` gradient
**Secondary (Teal)**: `#6CA3A2`
**Accent Highlights**: Subtle glows and inner shadows using brand colors


Text Colors

**Primary Text**: `#e5e5e5` to `#f5f5f5` - Light gray for readability
**Secondary Text**: `#c0c0c0` - Medium gray for supporting content
**Muted Text**: `#999999` to `#888888` - For less important information


8.5 Shadow System

Neumorphic Depth
Our signature soft 3D effect uses a dual shadow approach:

Light Shadow (Top-Left):
```
-10px -10px 24px rgba(70,70,70,0.5)
```

Dark Shadow (Bottom-Right):
```
10px 10px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.9)
```

Shadow Applications:

**Raised/Floating Elements**: Outer shadows with subtle inner highlights
**Pressed/Inset Elements**: Inner shadows creating depth (inset 8px 8px 16px)
**Interactive States**:
- Default: Medium shadow distance
- Hover: Reduced shadow distance (appears to lift)
- Active/Pressed: Inverted shadows (inset effect)


8.6 Component Patterns

Buttons

Primary Button (Orange):
- Rounded: `rounded-3xl` (24px)
- Gradient: `from-[#FF8C42] to-[#E67A33]`
- Raised effect with dual shadows
- Active state: Dark orange inner shadow

Secondary Button (Neumorphic):
- Background: `#1a1a1a`
- Text: Teal `#6CA3A2`
- Soft raised shadows
- Active state: Inset shadows


Cards & Panels

Inset/Pressed Panels:
- Background: `#151515` (darker than page)
- Inner shadows for depth
- Used for content areas, forms

Raised/Floating Cards:
- Background: `#1a1a1a` (same as page)
- Outer shadows for elevation
- Used for interactive elements, badges


Form Inputs

- Inset appearance (sunken into surface)
- Background: `#151515`
- Inner shadows: `inset 8px 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`
- Focus state: Teal glow


8.7 Typography

Font System

- **Primary Font**: Geist Sans (modern geometric sans-serif)
- **Fallback**: System font stack (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto)
- **Monospace**: Geist Mono (for code/technical content)

Font Weights for Neumorphic Design

Neumorphic design benefits from **heavier typography** for visual presence on dark backgrounds:

- **Hero Headings (H1)**: `font-extrabold` (800 weight), `tracking-normal`
  - Provides strong presence and tactile feel
  - Example: Hero section main heading

- **Section Headings (H2-H3)**: `font-bold` (700 weight), `tracking-tight`
  - Maintains hierarchy while being substantial
  - Example: Feature section titles

- **Body Text**: `font-normal` (400 weight), `tracking-normal`
  - Optimized for readability
  - Example: Descriptions, paragraphs

- **UI Elements**: `font-semibold` (600 weight)
  - Buttons, badges, labels
  - Example: CTA buttons

Text Shadows

- **Body text**: `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` - Subtle depth
- **Hero headings**: `0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.9), 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` - Embossed effect
- **Gradient text**: `none` - Must disable shadows to prevent outlines
- Creates embossed/raised appearance consistent with neumorphic style

Typography Hierarchy

- **Hero H1**: `text-4xl` to `text-7xl` (responsive), `#f5f5f5` color
- **Description**: `text-lg` to `text-xl` (responsive), `#c0c0c0` color
- **Buttons**: `text-base` (16px), White or `#6CA3A2` color
- **Badges**: `text-sm` (14px), `#e5e5e5` color


8.8 Spacing & Layout

Spacing Scale

Based on 4px grid system:
- **xs**: 4px
- **sm**: 8px
- **md**: 16px
- **lg**: 24px
- **xl**: 32px
- **2xl**: 48px

Border Radius

- **Small elements**: `rounded-2xl` (16px)
- **Medium elements**: `rounded-3xl` (24px)
- **Large elements**: `rounded-3xl` to `rounded-[32px]`


8.9 Interactive States

State Transitions

All interactions use smooth transitions:
- Duration: `300ms` for most transitions
- Easing: `ease-in-out` for natural feel
- No instant state changes


Button States

- **Default**: Raised with outer shadows
- **Hover**: Slightly reduced shadow (lifts closer)
- **Active/Press**: Inverted to inset shadows
- **Focus**: Subtle ring in brand color


8.10 Accessibility Considerations

Contrast Ratios

- All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- Primary text on dark background: High contrast
- Orange buttons with white text: 8.4:1 ratio
- Focus indicators are clearly visible


Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Clear focus states with visible outlines
- Logical tab order throughout application
