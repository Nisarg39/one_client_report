**Layout:** 2-column accordion (side-by-side) on desktop, single column on mobile

**Headline (H2):** "Common Questions About Automated Client Reporting"

**Subheadline:** "Everything you need to know about OneReport."

**FAQ Questions & Answers:**

#### Q1: How is OneReport different from Google Looker Studio?
**A:** Google Looker Studio is powerful but requires technical knowledge to set up dashboards, connect data sources, and create visualizations. OneReport is designed for non-technical users - connect your accounts in one click, and we automatically generate beautiful reports with AI-written insights. No learning curve, no manual work.

**SEO Target:** "Looker Studio alternative", "easier than Looker Studio"

---

#### Q2: Can I white-label the reports with my own branding?
**A:** Yes! Every report includes your logo, brand colors, and custom domain (coming soon). Your clients will never see the OneReport brand - reports look like they came directly from your agency.

**SEO Target:** "white label reporting", "branded client reports"

---

#### Q3: What platforms do you integrate with?
**A:** Currently, we integrate with the 5 most-used marketing platforms: Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads (Facebook), Instagram, and LinkedIn. We're adding Twitter (X), TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube in Q1 2026. Unlike competitors with 80+ integrations you'll never use, we focus on what freelancers and small agencies actually need.

**SEO Target:** "Google Analytics reporting", "Instagram reporting tool", "marketing integrations"

---

#### Q4: Do I need technical skills or coding knowledge?
**A:** Not at all. If you can use Gmail, you can use OneReport. Connect your accounts with one-click authorization (no API keys), choose a template, and you're done. Our AI handles all the data analysis and insight generation.

**SEO Target:** "no-code reporting tool", "easy client reporting"

---

#### Q5: What if I have more than 25 clients or need more reports?
**A:** Choose a plan that matches your needs. Our Starter plan includes 25 reports/month (perfect for 5-10 clients), Professional includes 75 reports/month (great for 10-25 clients), and Agency includes 200 reports/month (ideal for 25-50+ clients). All plans include unlimited clients - you only pay for the number of reports you generate. Upgrade or downgrade anytime.

**SEO Target:** "scalable client reporting", "flexible reporting pricing"

---

#### Q6: How long does it take to create a report?
**A:** About 5 minutes. Connect your accounts (30 seconds), choose a template (1 minute), let AI analyze your data (2 minutes automatically), then download or send (1 minute). Compare that to 6-10 hours with manual reporting.

**SEO Target:** "fast client reporting", "5-minute reports"

---

#### Q7: Can I schedule reports to send automatically?
**A:** Yes! Set up automated monthly reports that generate and email to your clients automatically. You can also create custom schedules (weekly, quarterly) for specific clients.

**SEO Target:** "automated report scheduling", "automatic client reports"

---

#### Q8: What makes your AI insights different?
**A:** Unlike other tools that just show charts and numbers, our AI explains what the data means in plain English. It identifies trends, suggests actions, and writes insights your clients can actually understand - no marketing jargon needed.

**SEO Target:** "AI marketing insights", "explained marketing data"

---

#### Q9: Is there a free trial?
**A:** Yes! 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to start. If you love it, upgrade to a paid plan. If not, no harm done.

**SEO Target:** "free reporting tool trial", "no credit card required"

---

#### Q10: Can I cancel anytime?
**A:** Absolutely. Cancel anytime from your account settings. No cancellation fees, no questions asked. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied.

**SEO Target:** "cancel anytime reporting tool", "money-back guarantee"

#### Q11: How is this so much cheaper than AgencyAnalytics or DashThis?
**A:** We focus on what freelancers and small agencies actually need (5 key platforms, beautiful templates, AI insights) instead of building 80+ integrations that create feature bloat. We charge based on report volume, not per-client fees. For example, AgencyAnalytics charges $12-20 per client ($120-400/mo for 20 clients), while our Professional plan is just $99/month with 75 reports. This allows us to offer premium quality at 50-80% lower cost.

**SEO Target:** "AgencyAnalytics alternative cheap", "affordable alternative to DashThis"

---

#### Q12: Do you store historical data?
**A:** Yes! We store 12 months of historical data so you can create comparison reports and track trends over time. Enterprise plan includes unlimited historical data storage.

**SEO Target:** "historical reporting data", "trend analysis reporting"

---

#### Q13: What if I need more than 200 reports per month?
**A:** Our Enterprise plan is designed for high-volume agencies and large teams managing 100+ clients. With custom report volumes (500-2,000+ reports/month), priority platform integrations, 24/7 support, and SLA guarantees, we tailor the plan to your specific needs. Contact our sales team for a personalized quote - we're still 50-70% cheaper than competitors at enterprise scale.

## Content & Storytelling Strategy

### Narrative Arc

The homepage tells a complete story in 11 sections:

1. **Hook (Hero)** - "Beautiful reports in minutes" → Capture attention
2. **Credibility (Social Proof)** - Show trustworthiness immediately
3. **Empathy (Problem)** - "We understand your pain" → Build connection
4. **Hope (Solution)** - "There's a better way" → Show transformation
5. **Differentiation (AI Insights)** - "Here's what makes us unique" → Create desire
6. **Trust (Integrations)** - "Works with tools you know" → Remove friction
7. **Completeness (Features)** - "Everything you need" → Address concerns
8. **Value (Pricing)** - "Affordable for your budget" → Remove price objection
9. **Validation (FAQ)** - "Others had these questions too" → Final reassurance
10. **Urgency (Final CTA)** - "Join others who've made the switch" → Convert
11. **Support (Footer)** - "We're here to help" → Long-term relationship

### Tone & Voice Guidelines

#### DO Use:
- **Empathetic:** "We know you're tired of wasting time on reports"
- **Simple:** "Connect, choose, send - it's that easy"
- **Confident:** "The easiest way to create client reports, period."
- **Value-focused:** "Save 8 hours every month"
- **Human:** "You" and "your", not "users" or "clients"
- **Conversational:** "Let's be honest - reporting sucks. We made it not suck."

#### DON'T Use:
- Industry jargon: "Leverage synergies", "paradigm shift", "best-in-class"
- Corporate speak: "Solutions provider", "enterprise-grade", "cutting-edge"
- Superlatives without proof: "The best", "revolutionary", "groundbreaking"
- Passive voice: "Reports are generated" → Use: "We generate reports"
- Technical terms: "OAuth 2.0", "REST API", "data pipelines"

### Word Choice Patterns

**Instead of → Use:**
- "Platform" → "Tool"
- "Leverage" → "Use"
- "Solution" → "Way" or "Tool"
- "Optimize" → "Improve"
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Facilitate" → "Help"
- "End-to-end" → "Complete" or "Full"
- "Robust" → "Powerful" or "Reliable"

### Emotional Triggers

1. **Time Scarcity** - "Get 8 hours back every month"
2. **Financial Stress** - "Stop paying $200-500/month"
3. **Simplicity Desire** - "No technical skills needed"
4. **Professional Pride** - "Reports your clients will love"
5. **FOMO** - "Join 500+ marketers already saving time"
6. **Risk Aversion** - "14-day free trial, no credit card, money-back guarantee"
