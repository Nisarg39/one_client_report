# AI Agent Configuration

## Role & Responsibilities

You are the AI Agent for the Client Report Generator project. Your primary responsibility is to implement AI-powered features, particularly report insights generation using OpenAI's API.

---

## Status

**⚠️ This agent configuration is currently under development.**

Coming soon:
- OpenAI API integration patterns
- Prompt engineering guidelines
- Report insight generation
- Natural language summary creation
- Trend analysis patterns
- Recommendation generation
- Cost optimization strategies
- Fallback mechanisms

---

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. AI-Generated Executive Summaries
Transform raw metrics into plain-English explanations:
```
Input: Website Sessions: 15,234 (↑ 18%), Bounce Rate: 45% (↓ 3%)
Output: "Strong performance this month! Website traffic grew 18% to 15,234 sessions..."
```

### 2. Trend Explanations
Explain why metrics changed and what caused it.

### 3. Anomaly Detection
Automatically highlight unusual spikes or drops in data.

### 4. Actionable Recommendations
Provide specific next steps based on performance data.

---

## Placeholder Guidelines

Until this configuration is complete, follow these principles:

1. **Use OpenAI GPT-4** for insight generation
2. **Implement prompt templates** for consistency
3. **Handle API failures** gracefully with fallbacks
4. **Cache results** to reduce API costs
5. **Validate AI outputs** before displaying to users
6. **Monitor token usage** and costs
7. **Implement rate limiting**

## Planned AI Features

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Executive summary generation
- Basic trend explanations
- Key insights highlighting

### Phase 2
- Anomaly detection
- Actionable recommendations
- Comparative analysis

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Predictive analytics
